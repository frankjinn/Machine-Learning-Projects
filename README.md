## Projects from CS189 Machine Learning at UC Berkeley.

- HW1: Classifying spam emails (SPAM: 93% accuracy) and handwritten digits (MNIST: 98.4% accuracy) with SVM.
- HW3: Linear and Gaussian discriminate analysis on spam emails (SPAM: 79% accuracy) handwritten digits (MNIST: 92% accuracy) dataset.
- HW4: Logistic regression model with regularization, and batch and stochastic gradient descent from scratch. Classifying color of wine (WINE: 95% accuracy) dataset.
- HW5: Implementing decision trees and random forests to create an interpretable model to classify spam emails (SPAM: 84% accuracy), and the survival of passengers on the Titanic (TITANIC: 82% accuracy).
- HW6: Fully functional dense and convolutional neural network from scratch, including activation functions such as ReLu, Sigmoid, and Softmax, and backpropagation calculations for each layer. This also included implementing batched training, with stochastic and regular gradient descent, and convolutional and pooling kernels with variable size and stride length.
- HW7: NN, K-NN, and SVD implementations. Used SVD for dimensionality reduction on movie recommendations (71% accuracy), and pre-made K-NN to classify nearest neighbors for geo-location (IM2SPAIN: 131 Km Mean Distance Error)
