Main code and training done on hw1.ipynb file. Just run the cells.
Featurize.py also edited. Used to produce a csv of most common words used in spam and ham, then cross-checked to eliminate words with high frequency in both lists (file included). The words that were left were added as new features. Potential improvement is to just include more words from that list.

Question 2e code in a seperate file named Q2.py.
